Avoid duplicate code. Use clear, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Keep functions small and focused. Dont write unnecessary comments—clean code explains itself. Move complex logic into helper methods.

Follow the Law of Demeter: only call methods of the object itself, its direct fields, received parameters, or locally created objects. Avoid chained calls like obj.getA().getB().doSomething()—wrap them in helper methods.

Start every new feature with a failing test. Write tests before fixing bugs. Only write production code after tests, but ask me first if I want to do it.


Always explain what you are doing and why you are doing it.
